This project is straightforward and does not support complex bonus features. However,
we trust your creativity. If you have completed the mandatory part, consider attempting
this bonus section.
Here are the bonus part requirements:
• Develop get_next_line() using only one static variable.
• Your get_next_line() can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.
For example, if you are reading from file descriptors 3, 4, and 5, you should be able
to read from a different file descriptor with each call, without losing track of the
reading state of each file descriptor or returning a line from a different one.
This means you should be able to call get_next_line() to read from fd 3, then fd
4, then fd 5, then again from fd 3, then fd 4, and so forth, without losing track of
the reading state for each file descriptor.
